I work hard to achieve my dreams and\n                    goals. Furthermore, I am someone who would go above and beyond for\n                    any company I work for and others in general. I believe in integrity\n                    and loyalty. My greatest strengths are sympathy and empathy. I am a\n                    caring and loving person that will always put my family and others\n                    before myself.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    My love and passion for technology started at a young age. Growing\n                    up around my brother and cousins playing video games fascinated me.\n                    My first time using technology was to play video games, and I loved\n                    it! Still do. As the years went by, I became more interested in what\n                    makes technology work. My passion grew even more when I studied I. T\n                    and Computer Sciences. Ever since, it has been my dream to pursue\n                    various fields in the tech industry.\n                </p>\n                <table class=\"table mt-5\">\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Name</th>\n                  <td>Jamie-Lee Kinnear</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Age</th>\n                  <td>21</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Gender</th>\n                  <td>Female</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <th>Nationality</th>\n                  <td>South African</td>\n                </tr>\n              </table>\n            </div>\n\n        </div>\n\n\n\n\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport Loader from '@/components/PageLoader.vue'\nexport default {\n    name: 'About',\n    components: {\n      Loader\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n.container img{\n    height: 450px;\n    width: 250px;\n    object-fit: cover;\n    border-radius: 30px;\n}\n\n\n</style>","import { render } from \"./About.vue?vue&type=template&id=2e52d6a8&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./About.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=2e52d6a8&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Desktop\\\\Vue-Portfolio2023\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-2e52d6a8\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=52c12539\"\nimport script from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Desktop\\\\Vue-Portfolio2023\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","name","components","Loader","__exports__","About","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
